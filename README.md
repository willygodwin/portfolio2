# Portfolio
Overview -

The portfolio is a website to showcase the web applications I have developed to date. I wanted to keep the portfolio simple and easy to navigate yet also visually appealing. 


Title/Nav bar -
The nav bar contains links to LinkedIn, Github and a download of the resumes. It also contains a toggle between the about page and portfolio page.
